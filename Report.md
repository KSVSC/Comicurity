## Objective
 The primary aim behind comicurity is to make the concepts regarding information security reachable to the non-technical audience in a comprehensive way through Comics. 
 We see that information security is very much involved in our lives these days. And it is necessary for a common man to have a basic knowledge about this. 
 Therefore, we believe that the work we are doing is essential.

## Challenges:
* Story board tool (no premium, not very user friendly, didn't find anybetter tool, couldn't collaborate therefore multiple people have to work on one scene many a time)
* Making the comic such that readers are engaged throught out the text.
* Thinking the storyline for comics is time taking. Had to spend days together for framing the story.
* Deciding and exploring the topics was hard too.
* Few chapters needed revisit as they were not up to mark (once we gradually improved in comic making we revisited the previous chapter and updated them).
* Proofreading
* Deciding the submission format and finally decided them to host on a website

## ThankYou Note:
This project turned out to be very helpful for ous in understanding various concepts. For all the concepts that we explored we did various brainstorming session for it, which would have not been in this way in our normal curriculum. Thank you very much for offering us such an interesting project on Information Security.
