## Objective
 The primary aim behind comicurity is to make the concepts regarding information security reachable to the non-technical audience in a comprehensive way through Comics. 
 We see that information security is very much involved in our lives these days. And it is necessary for a common man to have a basic knowledge about this. 
 Therefore, we believe that the work we are doing is essential.

## Challenges:
* Tool: Story board (No premium account, Not very user friendly, Didn't find anybetter tool, Couldn't collaborate, therefore multiple people have to work on same scene multiple times)
* Making the comic such that readers are engaged throughtout the text.
* Thinking the storyline for comics is time taking. Had to spend days together for framing the story.
* Deciding and exploring the topics was hard too.
* Few chapters needed revisit as they were not up to mark (Once we gradually improved in comic making we revisited the previous chapters and updated them).
* Since the account was not premium, proofreading and updating was quite challenging. 
* Deciding the submission format and finally decided them to host on a website

## Acknowledgement:
This project turned out to be very helpful for the whole team in understanding various concepts. For all the concepts that we explored, we did various brainstorming sessions, which would have not been same in traditional curriculum. We are grateful to be a part of this interesting project on Information Security. It was indeed a great experience. We thank the Prof. Kannan Srinathan and TAs for their valuable suggestions and being helpful throughout.
